ADGO 
- Academy for Sustainable Built Environment
- Architectural Engineering
- Civil Engineering
- Construction Business Administration
- Spatial Planning and Development
- 1600 students
- 3 ICTO's
- 80 Meta Quests

IDEA
- Civil Engineering is outside
- Often huge projects (dikes, ditches, rivers, canals)
- Difficult to do real scale in a lab
- Tpack (knowledge, education, technology) 
- 3D VR Immersive learning environment
- Multiplayer
- One has to do things (for example measure dimensions)
- Effect of changes is made visible immediately
- Show pressure and energy head
- The avatar should resemble the real person.

DEMO

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
- 2010 Learning in 3D
- 2013 ‚Äì 2014 Master learning and innovation (open simulator)
- 2016 Unreal Engine
- 1 day a week plus 
- 2019 Unreal Academy and Udemy courses
- 2020 Epic MegaGrant and unreal guru cedric
- 2 days a week 
- 2021 and 2022 Gamedesigner Sander
- 2022 ‚Äì 2025 Used in course Water 2

TECHNICAL DETAILS
- Unreal Engine 5
- Blueprints and a lot of C++
- Jetbrains Rider + github copilot  (free for educators)
- Server and Clients (dedicated server setup)
- 1 Avans windows server Unreal
- 1 Avans windows server MongoDB 
- Client available on itch.io

USE IN EDUCATION (OVER THREE YEARS)
- Part of Course Water 2 (3 credits)
- 5 assignments in groups of three
- 5 day‚Äôs including feedback (dag van de student)
- Summative assessment
- 150 students

UPS AND DOWNS
- Don‚Äôt call it a game, it is a learning environment. 
- ‚ÄúSerious gaming‚Äù sounds even worse
- Formative use is fun; summative use is stressful (it‚Äôs about grades)
- Students behave differently in 3D ‚Äì they go wild
- The avatar should resemble the real person?
- At first, they love it ‚Äì until it becomes mandatory

UPS AND DOWNS
- Updates, students get annoyed 
- Last minute changes, don‚Äôt do it
- Students always trust the system (even when it‚Äôs wrong)
- Not all students appreciate new/different methods
- Online support (e.g., Teams) doesn't work well ‚Äì physical presence is key
- Most students don‚Äôt watch instruction videos 
- Feedback sessions are effective

UPS AND DOWNS
- Luckily, I didn‚Äôt know how much time it would take üòä
- Although the goal is to save time üòä
- I get energy from the project; I am a bit crazy
- Colleagues have other priorities 

FUTURE
- My retirement 1-1-2026
- Trained AI avatars using Convai
- Standalone Meta Quest
- Worldwide accessibility

3 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH UNREAL FLUID DYNAMICS
- Henk Massink
- Lecturer Civil Engineering
- ICTO coach
- Fluid Dynamics nerd
- Unreal Engine nerd


THE PROGRAM
- The original idea
- The development process
- The technical stuff
- The "summative" use in education (over three years)
- The ups and downs
- The future

THE ORGINAL IDEA
- Civil Engineering is outside
- Often huge projects (dikes, ditches, rivers, canals)
- Difficult to do real scale in a lab
- 3D VR learning environment
- Multiplayer
- One has to do things (for example measure dimensions)
- Effect of changes is made visible immediately
- Show pressure and energy head

THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
- 2010 Learning in 3D
- 2013 – 2014 Master learning and innovation (open simulator)
- 2016 Unreal Engine
- 1 day a week plus 
- 2019 Unreal Academy and Udemy courses
- 2020 Epic MegaGrant and unreal guru cedric
- 2 day’s a week 
- 2021 and 2022 Gamedesigner Sander
- 2022 – 2025 Used in course Water 2

THE TECHNICAL STUFF
- Unreal Engine 5
- Blueprints and a lot of C++
- Jetbrains Rider + github copilot  (free for educators)
- Server and Clients (dedicated server)
- 1 Avans windows server Unreal
- 1 Avans windows server MongoDB 
- Client available on itch.io

THE "SUMMATIVE" USE IN EDUCATION (OVER THREE YEARS)
- Course Water 2 (3 credits)
- 5 assignments , groups of three
- 5 day’s including feedback (dag van de student)
- Summative
- 150 CT students

THE UPS AND DOWNS
- Don’t call it a game, it is a learning environment. 
- Serious gaming is worse.
- Formative is fun, Summative is not, it is about credits.
- Students behave totally different in a 3D world. They go crazy
- At first, they love it, and than it gets obligatory
- Feedbackclass works

THE UPS AND DOWNS
- Updates, students get annoyed 
- Last minute changes, don’t do it
- Students always believe the system
- Something different / new, not all students like it
- Support through teams, does not work. One should be present physically for help.
- Most students don’t watch instruction video’s 

THE UPS AND DOWNS
- I believe in Tpack (knowledge, education, technology) 
- Luckly, I did not know how much time :-)
- I get energy from the project; I am a bit crazy
- College's have other priorities

THE FUTURE
- My retirement 1-1-2026
- Convai avatars
- Worldwide accessible 

THE QUESTIONS?
- Thanks for being here
